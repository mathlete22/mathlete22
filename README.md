## üôè nomoshkar (pronounced naw-mo-shkar in bangla)

hi, i'm aniket (but why are you at this barren place?) and i'm a graduate student at chennai mathematical institute. recently i've been quite fond of writing everything in lowercase (maybe doing too much nlp preprocessing!). i hope i'm not offending anyone, if i am, well, be offended.

some topics i'm currently interested in are: 
1. **theoretical machine learning & deep learning**
2. **computer vision**
3. **natural language processing**

in between occasional study sessions, i can be found at the football ground or on lichess or roaming around on my bicycle.

### üîß some stuff that i know a bit...
